# SGP4 Python wrapper
Simple library for Python that wrapps C++ implementation of the SGP4 algorithm

SGP4 C++ implementation get from the [Celestrak](https://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.php) site. For the details of the algorithm please refer to the book "Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications" Fourth Edition by David Vallado.

Simplified perturbations models (SGP) used to calculate orbital state vectors of satellites and space debris relative to the Earth-centered inertial coordinate system [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_perturbations_models).
